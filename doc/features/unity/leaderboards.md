# Implementing Leaderboards

Leaderboard and Leaderboard List Unity Client script components handle the display of SUGAR leaderboards.

The Leaderboard Interface field is for the panel that contains all the Leaderboards available for the game. There is a fully functional LeaderboardPanel prefab template for this and any custom objects must have a LeaderboardUserInterface attached.

The Leaderboard List Interface field is for the list of users that appear in a leaderboard. There is a fully functional LeaderboardListPanel prefab template in the prefabs folder and any custom objects must have a LeaderboardListUserInterface attached.
