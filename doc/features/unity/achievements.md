# 4. Implementing Achievements 

The Achievement Unity Client script component handles all the visual elements of the game's achievements. 

* Achievement List Interface - Gameobject for displaying the full list of achievements available in the game. There is a fully functional template to use in the SUGAR prefabs folder. Any custom gameobjects must have the AchievementListInterace script attached to it.

* Achievement Popup - Gameobject to notify player when an achievement criteria has been met. There is also a template for this in the prefabs folder, custom gameobjects require AchievementPopupInterface attached to it. 

* Notification Check Rate - Rate at which the client checks to see if any new notifications (such as achievement criterias being met) are ready to display.
