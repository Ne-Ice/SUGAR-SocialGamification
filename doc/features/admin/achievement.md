# Achievements

*For more information on achievements view the <a href="../achievement.md">documentation</a>*

Achievements provide a flexible and simple way to increase user engagement, tracking their actions within and across multiple games. Achievements may be viewed as goals that individual or multiple actors can acquire through meeting one or more criteria.
 
The criteria is flexible and can be written by the game developer or provided by the platform based on any game specific action. Achievements can be binary or incremental, ie. (complete/not complete) or have levels or percentages of progression toward their completion. They can be global, across all games, or associated with a single game.
