# EvaluationData
EvaluationData is a storage system, following a key-value structure. It is used by SUGAR features and provides flexibility in providing custom game-specific storage solutions.

EvaluationData provides storage for <xref:achievement>, <xref:skill>, <xref:resource>, <xref:match> and <xref:gameData>.

EvaluationData is queried by <xref:achievement>, <xref:leaderboard> and <xref:skill> in their evaluations.
